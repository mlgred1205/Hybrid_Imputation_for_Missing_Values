#### The purpose of this repository is to provide the database search results and R scripts utilized during the analysis and publication of MS data. This specific analysis was performed with two different types of DDA bottom-up proteomics experiments, whole cell proteomics and immunoprecipitation. The public data was downloaded from PRIDE, searched with X!Tandem Fido on the OpenMS platform, analyzed with 6 types of missing value imputation methods and performance evaluated with statistical metrics following differential expression analysis.
